global motion but using fully convolutional network to predict every pixel motion
MNIST dataset
use 3 frames instead of 2 frames, the third frame is the supervision
Only get to 60% optical flow estimation accuracy, because most of the MNIST images has 0 background
And 0 background cannot estimate flow
